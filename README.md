# Penalized-KNN
A Penalized KNN model

Ideas:
Essentially make a knn model where each neighbor is weighted base roof how many neighbors we are looking at. So if n=10, the closest has weight 1, second has weight 0.9, etc. So essentially weights =[1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]

If tie, whatever is seen first

Can have distance calculated euclidean or taxicab

need two files, one for model one for data

data should have subclass for each point (x1, x2, x3, â€¦) and classifier (None or a string)
